    <p><strong>Controller</strong>: Design Future Games<br>
       <strong>Service</strong>: Mobile game <em>Block King Master : Classic</em> and related in-game features (puzzle stages, shop, ad rewards, etc.)</p>

    <p>This document explains what kind of information may be processed while you use the Service.  
       The Company <strong>does not operate its own backend servers</strong> and <strong>does not require you to create an account or provide your name, email address or similar personal identifiers</strong>.  
       When you uninstall the app, the game data on your device that is under the Company’s control is removed together with the app, and the Company does not keep separate copies.</p>

    <p>However, advertising and payment services provided by third parties such as Google may process and store data under their own responsibility, based on their own terms and privacy policies. In such cases, the policies and contracts of those third parties will prevail.</p>

    <h2>1. Purposes of Processing and Categories of Data</h2>

    <h3>1) Purposes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Providing and operating the Service</strong>: running puzzle stages, saving progress and scores, applying options and settings, and enabling basic gameplay features.</li>
      <li><strong>Displaying and managing advertisements</strong>: showing banner, interstitial and rewarded ads through Google AdMob, limiting frequency, preventing abuse and producing basic statistics.</li>
      <li><strong>Handling in-app purchases</strong>: processing paid items such as coin packs and ad-removal (NO ADS) products, verifying purchases and (where applicable) restoring them.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintaining app stability</strong>: using error and crash logs to improve quality and security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2) Data that may be processed (mainly via third-party SDKs)</h3>
    <p>The Company does not ask you to provide, nor does it store on its own servers, direct identifiers such as your name, email address or phone number.  
       The following types of information may be processed automatically by third-party SDKs such as those provided by Google, while the Company has access only to aggregated statistics or dashboards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device and app information</strong>: advertising ID (e.g. AAID), device model, OS version, app version, language and country settings, screen size and similar technical data.</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate location information</strong>: country/region inferred from IP address, for purposes such as ad performance measurement and fraud prevention.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: stage progress, scores, play time, button clicks, ad impressions and other basic usage events.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase information</strong>: product identifier (SKU), purchase time, Google Play purchase token/receipt, transaction status (success/cancel/refund, etc.).<br>
        <small>Payment instrument details such as card numbers are handled by Google Play Billing, and the Company has no access to them.</small></li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostic information</strong>: crash logs, error codes and other minimal data related to app stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3) Methods of collection</h3>
    <p>The above information is primarily processed <strong>automatically by third-party SDKs</strong> (such as Google AdMob and Google Play Billing) when you launch and use the app.  
       The Company may view the results only through the dashboards and tools provided by those third parties, within the scope necessary to operate the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Processing and Transfers</h2>
    <p>The Company does not sell your personal data. To provide the Service, the Company entrusts certain processing activities to the following third-party services. Their own terms and privacy policies apply first to how they process and store data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob (Google LLC)</strong>: provides banner, interstitial and rewarded ads, measures ad performance and prevents invalid traffic.</li>
      <li><strong>Google UMP (User Messaging Platform) SDK</strong>: obtains and manages consent for ad-related processing in regions such as the EEA and the UK.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Play Billing (Google LLC)</strong>: processes in-app purchases for items such as coin packs and ad-removal products, verifies receipts and handles refunds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers may process and store data in countries outside your own (for example, the United States). The details of such transfers and security measures are governed by each provider’s own privacy policy and terms.</p>

    <h2>3. Legal Bases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong>: providing the puzzle game, processing in-app purchases and enabling core functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: ensuring security, preventing fraud and abuse, improving quality and usability, and providing non-personalized (contextual) advertising.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong>: where required in certain regions, personalized advertising and some analytics features are based on your consent obtained via Google UMP or similar tools. You may withdraw such consent at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Company does not operate its own servers and <strong>uses only data stored on your device or within the store/platform ecosystem</strong>.</li>
      <li>When you uninstall the app, game data on your device that is under the Company’s control is removed with the app. The Company does not back up or restore this data independently.</li>
      <li>Advertising and purchase records held by Google or other third parties are retained and deleted in accordance with their own policies and applicable laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Uninstalling the app</strong>: you may uninstall the app at any time, which removes game data under the Company’s control from your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising ID and personalized ads</strong>: on Android, you can reset your advertising ID or limit ad personalization in the system settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad consent management</strong>: in the EEA, the UK and similar regions, you may be shown a consent screen (via UMP) on first launch. Where available, ad consent choices can later be changed from within the app or device settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Purchase management</strong>: details of purchases, refunds and payment methods can be managed in the Google Play Store and your Google account settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Requests to the Company</strong>: for data the Company can access, you may contact the Company using the information below to request access, deletion or restriction of processing, within the limits of applicable law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Third-party services such as those provided by Google may process your data in countries where their data centers are located (for example, the United States). In such cases, those providers implement appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable laws. The Company uses these services within the scope of the publicly available terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>The Company takes reasonable measures to protect data under its control, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>limiting access rights to personnel who need them,</li>
      <li>using encrypted connections (such as HTTPS) for network communication where applicable,</li>
      <li>maintaining access logs and attempting to prevent unauthorized access, and</li>
      <li>keeping the engine and plugins reasonably up to date to reduce known vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not primarily directed at children. The Company does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 14 (under Korean law) or under 13 (under U.S. COPPA standards) in ways that are not permitted by law.  
       If the Company becomes aware that such data has been collected improperly, it will delete it without undue delay or take steps to obtain verifiable parental consent.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Subject to applicable law and within the limits of what the Company can access, you may request access to, deletion of or restriction of processing of your personal data, or withdraw consent.  
       For data held by third-party providers such as Google, you must exercise your rights through their own procedures and policies.</p>
