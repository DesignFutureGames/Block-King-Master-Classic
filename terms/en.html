    <h2>Article 1 (Purpose)</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern the relationship between Design Future Games (the “Company”) and users (“Users”) with respect to the use of the mobile game <em>Block King Master : Classic</em> and all related services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

    <h2>Article 2 (Definitions)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>“User” means any person who agrees to these Terms and uses the Service.</li>
      <li>“Linked Services” means third-party services and SDKs that are integrated with the Service, such as Google Play Games, Google Play Billing, Google AdMob and Google UMP.</li>
      <li>“Virtual Currency (Coins)” means electronic data provided within the Service, whether paid or free, that can be used only inside the Service and cannot be redeemed for cash or similar monetary value.</li>
      <li>“Content” means all data and materials provided through the Service, including game data (stages, scores, progress, etc.), text, images, audio and other media.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 3 (Effect and Changes to the Terms)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>These Terms become effective when they are posted on the initial screen of the Service, the settings menu or otherwise made available to Users in a reasonable manner.</li>
      <li>The Company may modify these Terms to the extent permitted by applicable laws. In the event of changes, the Company will announce the details and effective date of the revised Terms within the Service or by other reasonable means. If the changes are disadvantageous to Users, the Company will notify them at least 30 days prior to the effective date.</li>
      <li>If a User continues to use the Service after the revised Terms have come into effect, the User will be deemed to have agreed to the revised Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 4 (User Requirements and Accounts)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Service is intended for general users and is not primarily designed for children.</li>
      <li>The Company does not operate its own account system and does not require Users to enter direct identifiers such as names or email addresses. Google Play Games login is an optional linked feature only.</li>
      <li>Users are responsible for appropriately managing access to their devices, Google accounts, passwords and other credentials, and are liable for any damages resulting from their failure to do so.</li>
      <li>If a minor makes a paid purchase without the consent of a legal guardian, whether cancellation or refund is possible will be determined in accordance with applicable laws and the policies of the Google Play Store.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 5 (Scope of the Service and Nature of Data)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Company may freely decide and change specific aspects of the Service, including stage structure, difficulty, items, events, visual effects and other game content.</li>
      <li>The Company does not operate a separate backend server for game progress. Game data is primarily stored and managed on the User’s device or within store/platform environments (for example, Google Play Games).</li>
      <li>When a User uninstalls the app, the game data on the device that is under the Company’s control is deleted together with the app. The Company does not independently back up or restore this data or keep separate copies.</li>
      <li>For data stored by Linked Services (such as advertising, billing and leaderboards), the policies and systems of the respective providers take precedence. The Company only views or uses the results within a reasonable scope.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 6 (Intellectual Property and License)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights in and to the Service and Content belong to the Company or the rightful owners.</li>
      <li>The Company grants Users a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to use the Service and Content solely for private purposes.</li>
      <li>Users shall not:
        <ul>
          <li>reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the game client or related systems,</li>
          <li>reproduce, distribute, publicly display, transmit, lend or sell Content without the prior consent of the Company, or</li>
          <li>engage in any act that infringes the intellectual property or other rights of the Company or any third party.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 7 (Prohibited Acts)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Using automated tools, macros, bots or similar means to use the Service in an abnormal way or to manipulate data or rankings.</li>
      <li>Exploiting bugs or vulnerabilities, making fraudulent payments or requesting unjustifiable refunds or chargebacks.</li>
      <li>Blocking or tampering with advertisements, or analyzing or modifying Service code or communications without authorization.</li>
      <li>Engaging in any act that violates applicable laws, public order or morals, or infringes the rights of third parties.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>The Service may provide multiple coin products and paid items such as ad-removal (NO ADS) that can be purchased repeatedly.</li>
      <li>Virtual Currency can be used only within the Service and, in principle, is not redeemable for cash or similar value. However, if applicable laws or store policies provide otherwise, such provisions shall prevail.</li>
      <li>The procedures and conditions for in-app purchases, refunds and purchase restoration are governed by Google Play Billing and the policies of the Google Play Store. The Company can only take action within the scope of those policies.</li>

      <li>In the event that the Service is terminated or a User ceases using the Service, whether unused Virtual Currency or similar in-Service items will be compensated or refunded will be determined by the Company after considering applicable laws, store policies and the operational status of the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 9 (Advertisements and Third-Party Services)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Service may include banner, interstitial and rewarded ads provided through Google AdMob and similar services. In certain regions, personalized ads may be limited and only non-personalized (contextual) ads may be shown depending on consent status.</li>
      <li>Linked Services (advertising, billing, leaderboards and others) are operated in accordance with the policies and terms of the respective providers. To the extent permitted by law, those providers bear primary responsibility for failures, errors or disputes concerning their services.</li>
      <li>If a User follows a link or uses a third-party service outside the Service, such use falls outside the control of the Company. To the extent permitted by law, the Company’s responsibility in such cases is limited.</li>

Unless otherwise required by applicable laws, the Company is not obligated to provide additional compensation for free features or unused Virtual Currency in connection with such termination.</li>
      <li>When changes or suspension of the Service occur, the Company will notify Users in advance to the extent reasonably possible. However, in urgent cases such as security issues, notice may be given afterwards.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Users may terminate their use of the Service at any time by uninstalling the app. Except where otherwise provided by applicable laws or store policies, unused Virtual Currency and similar items will not be refunded upon such termination.</li>
      <li>Even after termination of the Service or the User’s use, Articles 11 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 12 (Limitation of Liability), 13 (Indemnification) and 17 (Severability and Entire Agreement) shall remain in effect.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Article 15 (Governing Law and Dispute Resolution)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea.</li>
      <li>If a dispute arises between the Company and a User in connection with the Service, the parties shall first endeavor to resolve it through good-faith negotiations.
